                    Why do we say now the <span> Age of AI </span>? If anyone mentioned
                     this term AI ten years ago with any other,
                     he would be the laughing stock of all of them.

                    But, it is a hottest buzzword in today's industry. 
                    All the industries are now generating a lot of data and 
                    in a position to collect the data 
                     and all this is possible by this AI technology.

                    AI was discovered a long ago during 1970s but now it came into light. 
                    And, this only happens due to intensified research on data and found out 
                    that machines can do it far better than humans.
                     Then the research shifted on training machines to do this in smart a way as is possible.

                    But, exactly what is AI? AI is basically an idea of building machines which are capable
                     of thinking like humans. This was not the concept from start, it changes over time. 
                     In fact, humans are only capable to 
                    think and interpret the world through their information and bring change to the society.

                    If we want to do our work more efficiently then, it makes a good sense in using
                     ourselves as blueprint to train our machines. More research and 
                    advancements are happening in today's world which are going to be the future of our society.

                    What are the developments in AI? All of the advances are made possible 
                    due to intimating humans thought process. The field of research which has 
                    been most prominent in recent years is known as "machine learning". 
                    In fact, the terms AI and machine learning are often used interchangeably.

                    AI has its applications in almost every sectors from medical sector to E-commerce. 
                    In medical sector, AI is used to build machines to detect diseases and cure it easily.
                     Also helps in discovery of new drugs from historical medical data. In E-commerce,
                      AI system used to create recommend engines to engage customers better with customers 
                      through their past purchased items. Chatbots and virtual assistants are all AI powered 
                      which helps to communicate with users as personal as possible. In navigation too, 
                    AI applications like neural networks are used to detect road lanes and its obstructions.

                <p> 
                   <span>Robotics</span> is another common field where AI is used. Robots powered by AI use 
                   real time updates to do any tasks that a human can do but in more better and 
                   efficient way. It can be used to carry items in hospitals, warehouses, 
                   factories, etc. Even in hotels and restaurant AI powered Robots are used 
                   to serve the customers. In agriculture sector, AI is used to detect defects 
                   and weeds in crops, in harvesting it and even sow the seeds for humans and 
                   can work in all conditions. All these possible through computer vision, 
                   robotics and machine learning.

                    <span>Driver-less cars</span> are only possible due to these AI advancements. 
                    Vehicle's camera, radar, cloud services, GPS, control signals are
                     all done by AI powered systems which helps in making of self-driving cars.

                    Even from morning to night till we sleep we are all covered by AI applications, 
                    voice assistants in mobiles to smart homes. All social sites like Facebook, Instagram, 
                    Twitter used AI applications to detect frauds, posts, likes, dislikes of users to make 
                    it better to engage with.
